//! A text buffer for a text editor.
//!
//! Implements a Unicode-aware, layout-aware text buffer for terminals.
//! It's based on a gap buffer. It has no line cache and instead relies
//! on the performance of the ucd module for fast text navigation.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! If the project ever outgrows a basic gap buffer (e.g. to add time travel)
//! an ideal, alternative architecture would be a piece table with immutable trees.
//! The tree nodes can be allocated on the same arena allocator as the added chunks,
//! making lifetime management fairly easy. The algorithm is described here:
//! * <https://cdacamar.github.io/data%20structures/algorithms/benchmarking/text%20editors/c++/editor-data-structures/>
//! * <https://github.com/cdacamar/fredbuf>
//!
//! The downside is that text navigation & search takes a performance hit due to small chunks.
//! The solution to the former is to keep line caches, which further complicates the architecture.
//! There's no solution for the latter. However, there's a chance that the performance will still be sufficient.
